	<span class="numberleft">1</span><span class="promptleft">Good design is<br/>innovative</span>  
		
<span class="column2of2">Good design is met through using all resources, exploring new technology and advancements to further the ability of a product. Wireless headphones/earbuds to me were an innovative design because even though they are derived from an existing product, the design solved issues with having a wired attached to them by using the current technological advancement we currently have in the world. During the design phase I focus on an idea or a problem to solve from there I do a competitive research to know what has already been done and how those something work or the way it is used. Based on my research I would explore new technology, new ways of making things and innovations in materials maybe there is a material that those something nowv but didn't before.</span>

	<span class="numberright">2</span><span class="promptright">Good design<br/>makes a product<br/>useful</span>  
		
<span class="essayright">A design should equally meet aesthetics and function, aesthetics draw individuals in while functions is what captivates them fully. An example of an useful design is a pen. A pen is something useful, something that sometimes is disregarded but it is still needed. Incorporating other design principles is what can make it more memorable to a person. I will like to apply this principle to my work by creating products that are needed in society and are waiting to be perfected not just the way it looks but the way a person interacts and feels about it.  </span>

	<span class="number3">3</span><span class="prompt3">Good design is<br/>aesthetic</span>  
		
<span class="essay3">Design should be pleasing to the eye, a balance in colors and forms make a person more willing to use or even try a product or service. In example, a cell phone case, There are millions of cellphone cases everywhere, but if it was to come down to picking one out of them, most likely a person will select the case that meets the functions needed, but that they are also happy to show off. A way to meet the aesthetics criteria in design is by categorizing the needs of the product and what it will be used for, based on that information a form and style specifics can be choosen to appropietly fit the product or service. </span>

	<span class="numberright">4</span><span class="promptright">Good design<br/>makes a product<br/>understandable</span>  
		
<span class="essayright">A product or service should be self-explanotary. The design should be your guide. I think an user interface application can be an example of this, the way color is used in an app or webpages helps guide a consumers eyes to the most important parts of the page or to user look for most. </span>

	<span class="number5">5</span><span class="prompt5">Good design is<br/>unobtrusive</span>  
		
<span class="essay5">It those not get in the way of the function of the product by having the unnecessary. Making a chair look like a chair, making a product that is direct and the person knows what it is rather than trying to figure it out. I feel like this principle can help me design without over doing and adding unnecessary things.</span>

	<span class="number6">6</span><span class="prompt6">Good design is<br/>honest</span>  
		
<span class="essay6">It follows its philosophy. It doesn't contradicts itself. In one of my past designs, I designed a compost bin in which I tried to follow this design principle. I made a compost bin of compostable material, I wanted for the deign to show the importance the idea influenced the design. </span>
