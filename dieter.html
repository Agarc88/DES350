Dieter Rams: 10 Principles for Good Design 
<br>
	<br>
1. Good Design is Innovative
<br><br>
   Good design is met through using all resources, exploring new technology and advancements to further
    the ability of a product.
    
 Wireless headphones/earbuds to me were an innovative design because even though they are derived from an existing product,
    the design solved issues with having a wired attached to them by using the current technological advancement
    we currently have in the world.
   
    During the design phase I focus on an idea or a problem to solve from there I do a competitive research to know what has
    already been done and how those something work or the way it is used. Based on my research I would explore new technology,
    new ways of making things and innovations in materials maybe there is a material that those something now but didn't before.
    <br>
    <br><br>
 2. Good design makes a product useful
 <br><br>
    My Interpretation: That the product is something people dont just want but need. Something that will not just become paperweight.
    A pen. A pen is something useful, something that sometimes is disregarded but it is still needed and incorporating 
    other design priciples is what can make it more memorable to a peson.
   
    I will like to apply this principle to my work by creating products that are needed in society and are waiting 
    to be perfected not just asthetics but the way a peson interacts and feels about it.
    <br><br><br>
 3. Good design is aesthetic
    <br><br>
    My Interpretation: That a product is pleasing to the eye, a balance in colors and forms make a person more wiling to use
    or even try a product.
     A cell phone case, There are millions of cellphone cases everywhere, but id it was to come down to me picking 
    one out of them I will most likely select the case that meets the functions I need, but that I am also happy to show off. 
 
    A way I like to meet the aesthetics criteria is by categorizing the needs of the product and what it will be used for,
    based on that I can better select the color or forms that seem appropiate.
 <br><br><br>
	
 4. Good design makes a product understandable
 <br><br>
    My Interpretation: The product is basically self-explanotary. You dont have to explain excatly how to use it because the
    way the design is will be your guide.

    Example: I think an user interface application can be an example of this, the way color is used in an app or webpages helps guide a consumers eyes 
	to the most important parts of the page or to user look for most.
   
    <br><br>
  <br>
 5. Good design is unobtrusive
 <br><br>
	
It those not get in the way of the function of the product by having the unnecessary.
   Making a chair look like a chair, making a product that is direct and the person knows what it is rather than trying to figure it out.
    I feel like this principle can help me design without over doing and adding unnecessary things.
    <br><br><br>
 6. Good design is honest
 <br><br>
	It follows its philosophy. It doesn't contradicts itself. In one of my past designs, I designed a compost bin in which I tried to follow this design principle. I made a compost bin of compostable material, I wanted for the deign to show the importance the idea influenced the design. 
   <br><br><br>
	
 7. Good design is long-lasting
 <br><br>
	A design that will stay relevant even with the changing times.
    Having a design that is not tied to any type of current trend can help in making a design long lasting.
    <br><br><br>
 8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail

<br><br>
	That a design is not perfect in the first time you have to evaluate everything tied up to your design in order to make sure it is the best it could be.
    
    <br><br><br>
 9. Good design is environmentally-friendly
 <br><br>
	 A design will be responsible with the environment. Designing products comes with a waste of material, being that most designs require more than on the impact a product can make into the world is big.
 <br><br><br>
 10. Good design is as little design as possible
	<br><br>
	 Good design those not have to be extravagant to be good, sometimes the simpler a design is the better experience a consumer receives without wasting time in the unnecessary.
